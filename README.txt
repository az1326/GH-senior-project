This repository contains the source code and compiled Java Archive files for my senior project. The project will focus on
using Java standard libraries to create a GUI that uses the Model-View-Controller pattern.

The project consists of two small test apps and two large apps. The small test apps (test and testPNG) were completed
as a small-scale excercise new concepts. The two large apps (Tetris and SpaceGame) brought together many moving parts
to form a more cohesive, purposeful program.

The source code files for each project are located in the folder for the respective project. Executable Java Archive files 
for each project are located in the "jar Files" folder. These files should be executable on any machine that has at least
Java 8 installed. Java 8 can be downloaded at https://www.java.com/en/download/.
